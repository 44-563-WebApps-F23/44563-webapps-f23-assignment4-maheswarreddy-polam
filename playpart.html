    <p class="speech">How can you think that—?</p>
    
    <h5 class="mrs_stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
    <p class="speech">Won't you go in and have something, Mr. Hovstad? My
        husband is sure to be back directly.</p>

        Thomas share the credit as brothers?</p>

        are not satisfied with a share.</p>
