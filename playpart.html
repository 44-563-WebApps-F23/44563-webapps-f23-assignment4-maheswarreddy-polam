    <h4>An Enemy of the People Act 1</h4>
    <h4>Henrik Ibsen</h4>

    Mrs. Stockmann. My dear Peter—<br>

    Hovstad. How can you think that—?<br>
    
    Mrs. Stockmann. Won't you go in and have something, Mr. Hovstad? My
    husband is sure to be back directly.<br>
    
    Hovstad. Thank you, perhaps just a morsel. (Goes into the dining-room.)<br>
    
    Peter Stockmann (lowering his voice a little). It is a curious thing
    that these farmers' sons never seem to lose their want of tact.<br>
    
    Mrs. Stockmann. Surely it is not worth bothering about! Cannot you and
    Thomas share the credit as brothers?<br>
    
    Peter Stockmann. I should have thought so; but apparently some people
    are not satisfied with a share.<br>
